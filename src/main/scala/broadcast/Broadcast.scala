/**
 *
 * Local sending will just pass a reference to the
 * message inside the same JVM, without any restrictions
 * on the underlying object which is sent, whereas a
 * remote transport will place a limit on the message size.
 *
 * Messages which cannot be delivered (and for which this
 * can be ascertained) will be delivered to a synthetic actor
 * called /deadLetters. This delivery happens on a best-effort
 * basis; it may fail even within the local JVM (e.g. during
 * actor termination). Messages sent via unreliable network
 * transports will be lost without turning up as dead letters.
 *
 * An actor can subscribe to class akka.actor.DeadLetter on
 * the event stream, see Event Stream (Java) or Event Stream
 * (Scala) for how to do that. The subscribed actor will then
 * receive all dead letters published in the (local) system
 * from that point onwards. Dead letters are not propagated
 * over the network, if you want to collect them in one place
 * you will have to subscribe one actor per network node and
 * forward them manually. Also consider that dead letters are
 * generated at that node which can determine that a send
 * operation is failed, which for a remote send can be the
 * local system (if no network connection can be established)
 * or the remote one (if the actor you are sending to does
 * not exist at that point in time).
